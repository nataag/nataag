## Hi, I'm Natalia Almaraz  

I'm a Full Stack Developer with a background in Physiotherapy.

💻 My transition into tech started 8 years ago, when I started building WordPress websites on my own. After that, I’ve decided to acquire the skills to code web applications from scratch with a Full Stack training through CodeOp. Now, I’m able to code using modern JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue and I’ve developed a strong problem-solving ability.

🙆‍♀️ Curious, creative, organized and proactive person, empowered to create impactful products and work with enthusiastic teams. I believe my background as a Physiotherapist also brings a valuable perspective. 

I’m eager to use tech to create useful tools and help people make their lives easier!
