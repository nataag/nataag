Hi, I'm Natalia Almaraz  

I'm a Full-Stack Developer with a background in Physiotherapy and Osteopathy. I have always had a big curiosity for technology, Web Development and Design. In fact, this curiosity and motivation made me pursue a new professional challenge and reinvent myself.

My transition into tech started 8 years ago, when I started building WordPress websites on my own. After that, I‚Äôve decided to acquire the skills to code web applications from scratch with a Full Stack training through CodeOp. Now, I‚Äôm able to code using modern JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue and I‚Äôve developed a strong problem-solving ability.

I define myself as a curious, creative, organized and proactive person. Now I'm ready and empowered to create impactful products and work with enthusiastic teams. I believe my background as a Physiotherapist also brings a valuable perspective. 

I‚Äôm eager to use tech to create useful tools and help people make their lives easier!
